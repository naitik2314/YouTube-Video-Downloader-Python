# YouTube-Video-Downloader-Python
Let's get this, weall been through this, wanting to Download an YouTube video, so you have three options:
1. Download a free trial software, or get a software from crappy website, and get your system full of Virus.
2. Search Google for free download websites, and accidentally hit an ad button which says download, and making th esituation bit awkward.
3. Create your own Python Script, to download video, no crap, no virus nothing, just simplicity.

Well, I would go with the option 3, we are developers, we solve the problem ourselves, we are basically problem solvers.
